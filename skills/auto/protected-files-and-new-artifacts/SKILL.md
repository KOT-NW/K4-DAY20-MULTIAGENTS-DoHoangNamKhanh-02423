name: protected-files-and-new-artifacts
description: Use when a task forbids changing certain files or requires adding new files, tests, or changelog entries.
---
- Identify protected or read-only paths and required new artifacts before editing anything.
- Never modify protected fixtures, original tests, or input data; put changes in permitted new files.
- If a required artifact is missing, create it at the specified location instead of skipping it.
- For each bug fix or behavior change, add focused regression coverage when the task asks for it.
- Record fixes under the requested heading using the requested entry format when a notes or changelog file is required.
- Do not rely on existing visible tests as a substitute for required new tests.
- After editing, verify that protected paths are untouched and that every new artifact exists.
- If the task gives exact wording or naming for entries, reproduce that wording and naming.
