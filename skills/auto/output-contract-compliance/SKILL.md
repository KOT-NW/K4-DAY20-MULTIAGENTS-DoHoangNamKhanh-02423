description: Use when a task specifies required output files, schemas, field formats, or exact conventions.
---
- Before implementation, list every required artifact and its exact path, header, schema, field order, and formatting rule from the task.
- Treat output shape as a first-class deliverable; correct computations alone are not enough.
- Write all required files and fields, even when they are derived from the same source data.
- Apply unit, scaling, case, separator, and timestamp conventions exactly at output time.
- Include required metadata blocks with every mandated key and value.
- Follow required ordering; sort explicitly instead of trusting input order.
- Match any specified line or bullet format character-for-character.
- Omit or add optional fields only if the task explicitly permits it.
- Re-read the full task after computing results and confirm every output rule is still satisfied.
