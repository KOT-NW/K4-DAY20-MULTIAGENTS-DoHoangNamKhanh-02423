description: When a task lists multiple deliverables such as code fixes, tests, changelog entries, and output data files.
---
- At the start, enumerate every required deliverable and its exact format.
- Apply all stated coding standards (type annotations, docstrings, public API rules) to the relevant functions.
- Add new test files for fixes; do not modify provided tests or input data unless explicitly allowed.
- For each fix, add a changelog entry using the exact required pattern, bullets, and headings.
- Create every required output file, and include every required field or block.
- If any required artifact is missing, stop and create it before finishing.
- Re-read the task requirements and compare them to the final files.
- Prefer adding new files over editing protected or provided files.
